## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download

**Option A: Fork this repository**

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of this page
2. Clone your forked repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lyrics-cli.git
cd lyrics-cli
```

**Option B: Download as ZIP**

2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install colorama
```

Or if you're using Python 3 specifically:
```bash
pip3 install colorama
```

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Text

1. Open `lyrics_formatter.py`
2. Replace the example text in the `lyrics` variable with your own text
3. Set your desired `delay` time (in seconds)
4. Run the formatter:

```bash
python lyrics_formatter.py
```

**Example input:**
```python
delay = 2  # 2 seconds delay

lyrics = """
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of 
the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem has been the industry's standard
dummy text ever since the 1500s
"""
```

**Output:**
```python
("Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of ", 2.0),
("the printing and typesetting industry.", 2.0),
("Lorem has been the industry's standard", 2.0),
("dummy text ever since the 1500s", 2.0),
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Display

1. Copy the generated tuples from step 1
2. Open `main.py`
3. Replace the `title`, `description`, and `lyrics` variables
4. Customize individual delays if needed
5. Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Example configuration:**
```python
title = "My Song Title"
description = "Artist Name"
lyrics = [
    ("Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of ", 2.0),
    ("the printing and typesetting industry.", 2.0),
    ("", 1.0),  # Empty line for spacing
    ("Lorem has been the industry's standard", 2.0),
    ("dummy text ever since the 1500s", 2.0),
]
```

### Step 3: Advanced Features

#### Line Breaks
To add line breaks within a phrase, use `\n`:

```python
lyrics = [
    ("Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of \nthe printing and typesetting industry.", 2.0),
]
```

**Console output:**
```
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of 
the printing and typesetting industry.
```

#### Custom Delays
You can set different delays for each line:

```python
lyrics = [
    ("Fast line", 0.5),
    ("Slow line", 3.0),
    ("Medium line", 1.5),
]
```

#### Color Customization
In `main.py`, you can change the colors:

```python
# Current line color (line 7)
highlight = Style.BRIGHT + Fore.CYAN  # Change CYAN to your preferred color

# Background text color (line 6)
bg_text = Fore.LIGHTBLACK_EX  # Change LIGHTBLACK_EX to your preferred color
```

Available colors: `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, `MAGENTA`, `CYAN`, `WHITE`, `LIGHTBLACK_EX`, etc.
